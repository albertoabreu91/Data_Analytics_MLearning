# Lab | Introduction to Zeppelin

## Introduction

In this lab, we will practice loading data into Zeppelin, inspecting and modifying data types and creating plots with metrics based on the information included in the dataset. We will be working with the `liquor store sales` dataset, hosted in Ironhack's database.

## Getting Started

In `your-code` directory you will find a file called `main.json`. Import that file to Zeppelin and follow the step-by-step instructions to complete the lab.

## Deliverables

* `main.json` including the anwers to the challenges.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
